# Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
  The Gaming Room has a game called Draw it Or Lose It that they would like developed into a web-based game available to a variety of browsers and devices.

# What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
  I believe I addressed all necessary functions for the web-based game platform in a cost-effective way.
  
# What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
  Working through a design document helped me to visualize the "big picture" of the web-based platform while also helping me to address and organize requirements.

# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
  I would probably be a little more descriptive of the singleton pattern in the Domain Model section.
  
# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
  User needs were considered throughout the desing process. memory and storage were balanced to provide fast and easy use. A variety of client side applications were
  also implimented to support various user devices and browsers.

# How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
  I approached this software design template by weighing the pros and cons of various patterns and architecture styles to see which patterns best fit the client's
  needs.
